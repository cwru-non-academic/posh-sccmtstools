# Reporting a Vulnerability

1. Look at the [existing issues](https://github.com/cwru-non-academic/posh-sccmtstools/issues) to see if this vulnerability has already been reported.
2. If it has not, submit a new issue, tagging it as a bug.
3. If you have a fix, look at the [pull requests](https://github.com/cwru-non-academic/posh-sccmtstools/pulls). If one doesn't exists, create one. If one does, you can help with that one.

There is no guarantee on how quickly reported vulnerabilities will be fixed.
